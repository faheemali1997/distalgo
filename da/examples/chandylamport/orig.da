## Chandy Lamport Algorithm for Determining States of Gloabal System ###
########################################################################

# Algorithm:
# Marker Sending Rule (At snapshot initiator node S):
#       1. Node S saves its own state
#       2. Node S sends a "marker" message to all other nodes.
# Marker Receiving Rule (At receiver node R):
#       1. if reciever node R has not recorded its state:
#              a. R records its own state
#              b. R records the channel state from where the marker came as empty sequence
#       2. else: (if reciever node R has recorded its state)
#               R records the state of channel c as the sequence of messages received along c 
#               after R's state was recorded and before R received the marker along c.
# Termination of Algorithm: 
#       1. We terminate the algorithm when every node has received a marker and has recorded the channel and local state.
